# FOOD LIST

> This is a simple calculator. Enter a food and a quantity or weight in grams to make a list of total of each food.

I write this code because I have now a extremely food control. First I organized each food quantity or weight per day. Since I shop once a week, I want to know the total quantity or weight of each food I must buy.
With this code you can enter first the food and next the quantity. If the food already exists in the list, sum the new quantity with others.


## With the first version you can:

1. Run the code <br>
2. Choose one option what are describe with a print statement. <br>

### OPTIONS:

Write from 1 to 4 if want use the program:

1. **ENTER FOOD:** with low case, without white spaces, use "_" between words instead, singular words. This allow the program to understand when one food already exists.
2. **ENTER QUANTITY:** is an integer because is thinking to add grams or quantity not kilo.
3. **SAVE IN THE LIST:** This is *IMPORTANT* because, this option add the entered data in the list. Only save one food and one quantity per time.
4. **PRINT THE LIST:** print the list with the saved data.

OR

Press '*exit*' if want finish the program:

**EXIT:** finish the data enter. When choose this option, the program save all the list in the text file if list have data.
